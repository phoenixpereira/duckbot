### 1. Overview

This code defines a set of classes and functions for managing the Skullboard, a feature within a Discord server for tracking popular posts and active users. The core functionality revolves around a `SkullboardManager` class, responsible for handling reactions and updating or sending skullboard messages. The code also includes a `SkullGroup` class that defines a collection of Slash commands related to skullboard queries, providing users with access to information such as user rankings, Hall of Fame, weekly top posts, statistical distributions, and user-specific skullboard stats.

### 2. Class Structure

#### 2.1. SkullboardManager

The `SkullboardManager` class is responsible for handling Discord activities related to the skullboard. It leverages the `SkullboardDB` class to interact with the database, storing and retrieving data related to skullboard posts and user statistics.

| `__init__(self, client: Client)` | Initializes the `SkullboardManager` instance, setting up the client connection and database connection. |
| `get_reaction_count(self, message, emoji)` | Returns the count of a specific emoji reaction on a given message. |
| `handle_skullboard(self, message, skullboard_channel_id)` | Handles reactions to messages, updating or creating skullboard messages as needed. |
| `update_or_send_skullboard_message(self, channel, message, current_count, emoji)` | Updates an existing skullboard message or sends a new one based on the current reaction count. |
| `get_gif_url(view_url)` | Extracts the GIF URL from a Tenor view URL. |
| `edit_or_send_skullboard_message(self, channel, message, current_count, emoji, send=False, skullboard_message_id=None)` | Edits an existing skullboard message or sends a new one, including appropriate content and embeds. |

#### 2.2. Response
